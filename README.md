# Communication Theory

## Overview
Information theory and digital communications: limits of transmission/compression, coding for reliability, modulation and detection over noisy channels, synchronization/equalization, and performance analysis for practical links.

## Topics
- Information theory: entropy, mutual information, channel capacity, rate-distortion
- Error-control coding: block, cyclic, convolutional; Viterbi decoding
- Baseband/bandpass signaling; constellations
- Noise and channel models
- Analog/digital modulation: AM/PM/FM and digital amplitude/phase/frequency formats
- Receivers: MAP and ML detection
- ISI and equalization
- Coherent/non-coherent detection
- Carrier recovery and synchronization
- Link performance: SNR, BER, power and bandwidth tradeoffs
- Multiple access; OFDM
